# Pay-by-word payment processor

This is a cartridge for **SFRA 6** as unusual **payment provider extenstion**.
The point is that it can be used as a normal payment provider, but instead of paying with money, one can pay by simply put some **good words** as a payment equivalent. The process is simple and the goal is to illustrate payment provider implementation with 3P API integration. In this case the **[Perspective comment analyzer API](https://perspectiveapi.com/how-it-works/)** is used.

### **Marush Denchev** enspired me to work on this.

#### Enjoy!
